General information about
[OpenStreetMap on GitHub](https://github.com/openstreetmap):

 * This is an organization account that contains both canonical
   repositories
   (e.g. [osmosis](https://github.com/openstreetmap/osmosis)), mirrors
   of other Git repositories
   (e.g. [openstreetmap-website](https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website)),
   and mirrors of Subversion repositories
   (e.g. [JOSM](https://github.com/openstreetmap/josm)).
   
 * If you'd like to get a new remote repository mirrored follow the
   instructions in the
   [mirroring README](https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-mirror/blob/master/README.md)

 * If you'd like to host an OpenStreetMap-related project here contact
   either [bastik](https://github.com/bastik) or
   [avar](https://github.com/avar) who can create repositories for
   you, as well as creating a team for your project and make you the
   admin of that team.

   After that's set up you'll be able to do all the maintenance of
   your repository (e.g. adding users to it) yourself just as you
   would with a regular GitHub repository.
   
   You can of course just host an OpenStreetMap-related project under
   your own user account, but the advange of setting it up under this
   organization is that it'll have higher visibility to people
   browsing related projects.
